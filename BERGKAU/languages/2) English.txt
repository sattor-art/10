Uncompromising Quality

At Bergkau, "premium" is not just a wordâ€”it's our standard. Our integrated production and rigorous two-stage quality control system guarantee that every product meets the highest expectations.

From Raw Material to Finished Product

Incoming Material Inspection: Before production even begins, our rubber compounds undergo up to 16 different tests (including tensile strength, ozone resistance, and low-temperature flexibility) to ensure perfect properties.

Final Product Validation: Every finished air spring is subjected to life cycle simulation, load capacity, expansion, and burst pressure tests. This ensures exceptional durability and safety in real-world conditions.

Our quality management system is certified to IATF 16949 (the successor to ISO/TS 16949), underscoring our commitment to meeting the strictest international automotive standards.
